## What is it
this is the server, made with Ktor and other kotlin pluggins.
Is currently deployed on a VM (with a linux debian distribution), in google cloud.

## Features
It's using MongoDB to store the data and Ktor for communication with the app,
because it includes a multiplatform asynchronous Http client,
which allows me to make requests and handle responses.
I configured it to automatically restart if something happens.
